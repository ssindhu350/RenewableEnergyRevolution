"Heat generation (TJ) is the total heat produced by the installation and includes the heat used by the installation's auxiliaries that use a hot fluid (liquid fuel heating, etc.) and losses in the installation/network heat exchanges, as well as heat from chemical processes used as a primary energy form. For autoproducers, the production of heat covers only the heat sold to third parties; thus, gross heat production for autoproducers is equal to net heat production. This heat is not to be confused with heat consumption. Producer type CHP is short for Combined Heat and Power producer.",,,,
