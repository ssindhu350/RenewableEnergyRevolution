## pgvector

Open-source vector similarity search for Postgres

Store your vectors with the rest of your data. Supports:

- exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- single-precision, half-precision, binary, and sparse vectors
- L2 distance, inner product, cosine distance, L1 distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard distance
- any [language](#languages) with a Postgres client

Plus [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliance, point-in-time recovery, JOINs, and all of the other [great features](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) of Postgres

See the [installation notes](#installation-notes---linux-and-mac) if you run into issues

You can also install it with [Docker](#docker), [Homebrew](#homebrew), [PGXN](#pgxn), [APT](#apt), [Yum](#yum), [pkg](#pkg), [APK](#apk), or [conda-forge](#conda-forge), and it comes preinstalled with [Postgres.app](#postgresapp) and many [hosted providers](#hosted-postgres). There are also instructions for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pgvector/setup-pgvector).

### Windows

Ensure [C++ support in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#download-and-install-the-tools) is installed and run `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS [version]` as administrator. Then use `nmake` to build:

```cmd
set "PGROOT=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18"
cd %TEMP%
git clone --branch v0.8.1 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
cd pgvector
nmake /F Makefile.win
nmake /F Makefile.win install
```

See the [installation notes](#installation-notes---windows) if you run into issues

You can also install it with [Docker](#docker) or [conda-forge](#conda-forge).

## Getting Started

Enable the extension (do this once in each database where you want to use it)

```tsql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```
### SQL Scripts

Run the sql scripts in the sql folder. Only to create the tables.

```tsql
CREATE DATABASE energyDB
    WITH
    OWNER = postgres
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LOCALE_PROVIDER = 'libc'
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
    IS_TEMPLATE = False;

COMMENT ON DATABASE energyDB
    IS 'Database for world's energy generation, production and consumption.';

```

### Python scripts

We run python scripts to embed and load to the tables.
run reguired pip installs.
